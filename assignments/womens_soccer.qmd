We'll use this notebook to explore some NCAA women's soccer data and [our questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kTSrnl1URmcexIWLDMWqDnp3q-c2OS45uifnhjp10n4/edit#gid=0). First, let's load the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll want to start with 2023 match data, which is located in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData). We can load the match data directly from GitHub using `read_csv`:


```{r}
matches_2023 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2023.csv")

matches_2022 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2022.csv")
```

Let's take a look at this data to see what it contains, using `head` and `glimpse`:

```{r}
head(matches_2023)
glimpse(matches_2023)
```

Now, onto the questions using aggregates, which means `group_by` and `summarize`:

1. How many shots in total has Maryland attempted and how many have been on goal? Calculate a percentage of shots on goal.

```{r}
matches_2023|>
  group_by(team)|>
  summarise(
    total_shots = sum (sh_att),
    total_on_goal = sum(so_g),
    percent = (total_on_goal/total_shots)*100
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(percent))
```

2. What about the same shot stats from last season's first four games? You'll need to load the matches from 2022 - just change the season in the URL - and filter by date to find the first four games.

```{r}
matches_2022|>
  filter (date < '2022-09-04')|>
  filter (team == 'Maryland Terrapins, Terps') |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarise(
    total_shots = sum(sh_att),
    total_on_goal = sum(so_g),
    percent = (total_on_goal/total_shots)*100
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(percent))
```


3. What about draws - Maryland started 2022 with 4 ties. Have any other teams had as many this season?

```{r}
```


4. How many total corner kicks has Maryland had so far and how many have its opponents have? Calculate the difference between the two totals for every team.

```{r}
```
