Based off of Net Rounds, you can't accurately predict who will win and lose but there is a relation between net rebounds and outcomes of games. 


```{r}
rebounds_turnovers <- lm(Differential ~ NetRebounds + TurnoverMargin, data=logs)
summary(rebounds_turnovers)
```
Residual Standard Error = the smaller the number, that's a good thing
multicollinearity = don't add in things don't relate to each other

```{r}
simplelogs <- logs |> select_if(is.numeric) |> select(-Game) |> select(Differential, NetRebounds, TurnoverMargin, TeamFGPCT, TeamTotalRebounds, OpponentFGPCT, OpponentTotalRebounds)
```
simple logs= only has numeric columns 

```{r}
cormatrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(simplelogs))

cormatrix$r
```
+1 positive correlaton, -1 negative correlation 
you want to look at something that is positively correlated but not the same thing (Differential + FGPCT)
