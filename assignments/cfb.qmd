First play: teams are inconsistent about what is defined as a first play.

The p-value is 2.2e-16 so this means the results can be random but are still related in some way. The r-square value is 0.02 which means the differential in score isn't entirely related to how many penalties a team gets. This regression might work better for individual teams (i.e. Maryland who may or may not get bogus calls seemingly every game) to see if penalties impact a teams win/loss record.  


```{r}
simplelogs <- logs |> select_if(is.numeric) |> select(-Game) |> select(Differential, Penalties, TotalTurnovers, TeamScore, OpponentScore, DefRushingYds, OffensivePlays)

```{r}
cormatrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(simplelogs))

cormatrix$r

Okay so I will say this, I think I just kinda proved that defense wins games by accident. But I choose Offensive plasy and Defensive plays because I wanted to see if there was a possibility that either one would correlate to the differential. There's not much of a relationship BUT it does seem like there is more of a relationship when the defense makes a turnover. There's also some kind of relationship when the offense has more penalties. It's interesting to me because I would've figured penalties and turnovers would affect both sides of the ball not just one. 

```{r}
close_games <- logs |> filter(Differential < 7)
```

I'm lost on the last one. I'm not sure how to "define" close games. Because I would define a game that is decided by 7 points or less a close game. I'm just not sure how to do that. I did look at the code block from the basketball one we did and played around with different variables but I'm still not sure. Pls help.
