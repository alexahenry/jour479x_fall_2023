Field Hockey - scatter plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
logs <- read_csv("https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/fieldhockey22.csv")
```

```{r}
winlosslogs <- logs |> 
  mutate(
    winloss = case_when(
      grepl("W", result) ~ 1, 
      grepl("L", result) ~ 0)
)
```

```{r}
goals_wins <- winlosslogs |> 
  group_by(team) |> 
  summarise(
    wins = sum(winloss), 
    total_goals = sum(goals)
    ) |> na.omit()
```
na.omit is taking out any data that there isn't data for 

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data=goals_wins, aes(x=total_goals, y=wins))
```

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=goals_wins, aes(x=total_goals, y=wins)) +
  geom_smooth(data=goals_wins, aes(x=total_goals, y=wins), method="lm")
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(wins ~ total_goals, data = goals_wins)
summary(fit)
```
