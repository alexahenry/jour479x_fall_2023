```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(hoopR)
```

```{r}
lineups <- nba_teamdashlineups(team_id = 1610612763)[[2]]
```

```{r}
  lineups <- lineups |> 
  mutate(across(starts_with("GP"):ncol(lineups), as.numeric))
```

```{r}
lineups |>
  select(GROUP_NAME, GP, MIN, PLUS_MINUS) |>
  arrange(desc(MIN))
```
My main takeaway is mainly that the Grizzles are pretty mid but their best line up is when Tillman and Zaire Williams are not in the lineup they are +13 than when they are both in the lineup.
